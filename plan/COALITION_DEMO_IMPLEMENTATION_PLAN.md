## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas

**1. D'Hondt Electoral Algorithm Accuracy**
- **Risk**: Algorithm fails to produce exact 2023 Dutch election results
- **Impact**: Complete authenticity failure, demo credibility destroyed
- **Probability**: Medium (complex mathematical implementation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement with TDD approach and comprehensive test suite
  - Validate against multiple historical elections (2017, 2021, 2023)
  - Expert mathematical review before Week 2
  - Fallback: Use simplified proportional representation if needed

**2. Coalition Compatibility Algorithm Validation**
- **Risk**: Algorithm doesn't match real Dutch political expert assessments
- **Impact**: Core game mechanic feels inauthentic to target users
- **Probability**: High (subjective political knowledge required)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Early prototype validation with Dutch political experts
  - Test against historical coalition outcomes (1946-2023)
  - Iterative refinement based on expert feedback
  - Fallback: Simplified ideological distance calculation

**3. User Recruitment for Testing**
- **Risk**: Cannot recruit 15+ qualified Dutch political enthusiasts
- **Impact**: Unable to validate core concept with target demographic
- **Probability**: Medium-High (specialized demographic)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start recruitment by Week 2, not Week 4
  - Multiple recruitment channels (universities, political forums, social media)
  - Flexible testing schedule accommodating participant availability
  - Fallback: Remote testing sessions, broader European political enthusiasts

**4. Desktop UI Metaphor Acceptance**
- **Risk**: Desktop metaphor confuses users rather than enhancing experience
- **Impact**: Core differentiator becomes liability, poor user experience
- **Probability**: Medium (innovative but unproven concept)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Early concept validation with small user group in Week 2
  - Progressive disclosure, starting with simple windows
  - Alternative simplified interface as backup
  - Fallback: Traditional single-screen interface

### Medium-Risk Areas

**5. Unity 6 Platform Stability**
- **Risk**: Unity 6 introduces unexpected bugs or performance issues
- **Impact**: Development delays, technical instability
- **Mitigation**: Thorough early testing, Unity LTS fallback plan

**6. Political Data Accuracy and Currency**
- **Risk**: Inaccurate or outdated political information
- **Impact**: Authenticity questioned by knowledgeable users
- **Mitigation**: Multiple official source cross-referencing, expert validation

**7. Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- **Risk**: Demo doesn't work consistently across Windows/macOS
- **Impact**: Limited user testing reach, technical support burden
- **Mitigation**: Multi-platform testing throughout development, primary platform focus
