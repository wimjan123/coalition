## ðŸ”— **RESEARCH TO IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING**

### **D'Hondt Electoral System** (Steps 1.1-1.3)

**Research Source**: [`docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md`](../../docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md) - Section 2.3: Electoral Mechanics
**Key Research Insights**:
- Netherlands uses pure proportional representation without electoral threshold
- D'Hondt method allocates 150 seats across 19 electoral districts
- Remainder distribution follows largest remainder rule
- **Historical Validation**: 2023 election produced 15 parties in parliament

**Implementation Rationale**:
- **Step 1.1**: Mathematical precision required to match real election outcomes
- **Step 1.2**: No threshold needed but remainder handling critical for accuracy
- **Step 1.3**: Visual representation must match actual Tweede Kamer semicircle layout

**Validation Criteria**: Algorithm must produce exact 2023 results: VVD (34), PVV (37), NSC (20), GL-PvdA (25), etc.

### **Political Party Database** (Steps 2.1-2.4)

**Research Source**: [`docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md`](../../docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md) - Section 3: Party Analysis (3,400 words)
**Key Research Data**:
- Complete ideological positioning for 12 major parties on 4 axes
- 2023 election performance with exact vote counts and percentages
- Coalition history and compatibility matrices from 1946-2023
- Leadership data and party characteristics

**Research-Backed Party Data**:
| Party | Research Section | Ideological Position | 2023 Results | Coalition History |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **VVD** | 3.1.1 | Economic +7, Social +2, EU +6 | 34 seats (20.1%) | Rutte I-IV coalitions |
| **PVV** | 3.1.2 | Economic +2, Social -4, EU -8 | 37 seats (20.2%) | Coalition excluded |
| **NSC** | 3.1.3 | Economic +4, Social -1, EU +5 | 20 seats (12.9%) | New party 2023 |
| **GL-PvdA** | 3.1.4 | Economic -6, Social +8, EU +7 | 25 seats (15.8%) | Left alliance |

**Implementation Cross-References**:
- **Step 2.2**: VVD data directly from research Section 3.1.1
- **Step 2.3**: PVV positioning validated against research Section 3.1.2
- **Step 2.4**: All remaining parties mapped to research Sections 3.1.5-3.1.12

### **Coalition Formation Logic** (Steps 3.1-3.3)

**Research Source**: [`docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md`](../../docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md) - Section 4: Coalition Formation (2,100 words)
**Key Research Insights**:
- Dutch coalition formation averages 104 days (2010-2023)
- Ideological distance predicts coalition viability with 89% accuracy
- Portfolio allocation follows proportional strength with PM from largest party
- **Historical Precedent**: Rutte IV formation (2021) took 271 days - longest in Dutch history

**Research-Validated Algorithm**:
```
Compatibility Score = (1 - IdeologicalDistance/20) + HistoricalBonus - RedLinesPenalty
Where:
- IdeologicalDistance: Euclidean distance across 4 political axes
- HistoricalBonus: +0.2 for previous coalition partners
- RedLinesPenalty: -1.0 for explicit exclusions (e.g., all parties exclude PVV)
```

**Implementation Cross-References**:
- **Step 3.1**: Compatibility algorithm based on research Section 4.2: Mathematical modeling
- **Step 3.2**: Portfolio allocation follows research Section 4.3: Cabinet formation
- **Step 3.3**: Negotiation timeline from research Section 4.4: Historical analysis

### **Political Issue System** (Steps 4.1-4.3)

**Research Source**: [`docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md`](../../docs/DUTCH_POLITICS.md) - Section 5: Issue Landscape (1,800 words)
**Key Research Data**:
- 15 major Dutch political issues ranked by voter importance (2023 surveys)
- Issue position mapping for all parties with standard deviations
- Media attention cycles and salience modeling
- **Voter Priority Data**: Healthcare (89% important), Housing (87%), Climate (71%)

**Research-Informed Issue Framework**:
| Issue Category | Voter Importance | Media Attention | Party Polarization |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Healthcare (Zorg)** | 89% critical | High (daily coverage) | Low (broad consensus) |
| **Housing (Wonen)** | 87% critical | Very High (crisis coverage) | Medium (solution disagreement) |
| **Immigration** | 76% important | Very High (political focus) | Very High (party defining) |
| **Climate** | 71% important | High (policy cycles) | High (economic vs environment) |

**Implementation Cross-References**:
- **Step 4.1**: Issue database from research Section 5.1: Issue taxonomy
- **Step 4.2**: Position calculations use research Section 5.2: Party positioning
- **Step 4.3**: Voter modeling based on research Section 5.3: Demographic analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ **COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION CONTEXT**

**Research Source**: [`docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`](../../docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md)
**Market Gap Identified**: No existing games authentically model Dutch coalition formation

**COALITION's Unique Approach**:
1. **Authentic D'Hondt Implementation**: Unlike Democracy 4's simplified system
2. **Multi-Party Coalition Dynamics**: Beyond Political Machine's two-party focus
3. **Dutch Cultural Context**: Specific to Netherlands vs. generic parliamentary systems
4. **Historical Validation**: Verified against 77 years of Dutch election data

**Implementation Impact**:
- **Authenticity Requirements**: Every political mechanic must match Dutch reality
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Language, procedures, and norms must be Dutch-specific
- **Expert Validation**: Academic review required for political accuracy
