# COALITION - Ethics, Safety Guidelines, and Content Policies

## Ethical Framework Overview

COALITION operates under a comprehensive ethical framework that balances authentic political simulation with responsible content creation, democratic values protection, and user safety. This framework governs all aspects of the game, from AI content generation to player interaction systems.
