# COALITION - Dutch Political Desktop Simulation

## Project Overview

COALITION is a long-form political simulation game set in the Netherlands, presented as a fictional desktop environment. Players experience the complete journey of Dutch politics - from campaigning and elections through coalition negotiations, cabinet formation, and governance - all within an immersive interface of messages, briefings, policy memos, press releases, and social media feeds.

The game combines serious political realism with sharp satirical commentary, offering players an authentic simulation of Dutch political processes while remaining engaging and accessible.

## Core Concept

Players navigate the complex world of Dutch coalition politics through a desktop interface that feels like a real political operative's workspace. The game emphasizes:

- **Authentic Dutch Political Simulation**: Based on real Dutch institutions, parties, and political processes
- **Coalition-Centered Gameplay**: Focus on the unique challenges of forming and maintaining multi-party coalitions
- **AI-Driven Social Media**: Dynamic social media responses and public opinion that react to player actions
- **Long-Form Sessions**: Deep, extended gameplay sessions with meaningful progression over time
- **Desktop Environment Metaphor**: Interface designed as a realistic political workspace

## Key Features

### Political Simulation
- Complete election cycle simulation from campaign to governance
- Realistic coalition formation mechanics based on Dutch political processes
- Authentic party system with ideologically diverse political parties
- Media framing and public opinion systems that respond to player actions
- Policy implementation with real-world consequences and trade-offs

### Technical Innovation
- Cross-platform desktop application (macOS priority)
- AI-powered social media and news generation using LLM APIs
- Real-time simulation of political processes and public opinion
- Robust save/continue functionality for long session support
- Multi-window interface resembling a political operative's desktop

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Core game engine and desktop framework implementation
- Basic Dutch political system simulation
- Simple coalition formation mechanics
- Fundamental UI framework and window management

### Phase 2: Core Features (Months 4-6)
- Complete political party system with AI-driven behavior
- Advanced coalition negotiation mechanics
- Basic social media and news systems
- Policy implementation framework

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Months 7-9)
- LLM API integration for dynamic content generation
- Advanced social media response systems
- AI-driven public opinion modeling
- Dynamic news and media coverage

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Months 10-12)
- User interface refinement and polish
- Comprehensive testing and debugging
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and player onboarding

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience
- Political simulation enthusiasts
- Players interested in European politics
- Fans of complex strategy games with authentic systems
- Dutch players seeking representation of their political system

### Secondary Audience
- Educational users (political science students, educators)
- Players of grand strategy games (Paradox Interactive audience)
- Desktop simulation game fans

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Stable performance across target platforms (especially macOS)
- Successful AI integration with reasonable response times
- Robust save/load functionality supporting multi-hour sessions

### Gameplay Metrics
- Average session length (target: 2+ hours)
- Player retention through complete political cycles
- Successful coalition formation rates by player experience level

### Content Quality Metrics
- Authentic representation of Dutch political processes
- Balanced and engaging political party interactions
- Meaningful player agency in political outcomes

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
- **AI Integration Complexity**: Managing costs and quality of LLM API usage
- **Political Sensitivity**: Balancing authenticity with responsible representation
- **Technical Complexity**: Desktop framework selection and implementation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prototype AI systems early with cost controls and fallback options
- Establish clear content guidelines and review processes
- Choose proven desktop frameworks with strong community support
