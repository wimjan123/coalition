# COALITION - AI-Driven Social Media and Media Framing Systems

## Overview

COALITION's media simulation creates an authentic Dutch media landscape that responds dynamically to player actions through AI-generated content, realistic media framing, and sophisticated public opinion modeling. The system balances authenticity with engaging gameplay while managing technical and cost constraints.

## Dutch Media Landscape Integration

### Authentic Media Outlets

#### Public Broadcasting (NPO/NOS)
- **Primary News Source**: 89% public trust, institutional credibility
- **Coverage Style**: Balanced, institutional, factual reporting
- **AI Persona**: Formal, measured language; consensus-building tone; institutional respect
- **Reaction Patterns**: Slower to react, emphasizes democratic process over sensationalism

#### Commercial Broadcasting (RTL)
- **Market Position**: Primary NOS competitor, commercial focus
- **Coverage Style**: More commercial, slightly sensationalist, ratings-driven
- **AI Persona**: More dramatic headlines, personality-focused coverage, competitive framing
- **Reaction Patterns**: Faster reaction times, emphasis on conflict and drama

#### Print Media (DPG Media/Mediahuis)
- **Market Control**: 90%+ newspaper ownership concentration
- **Editorial Diversity**: Range from centre-left to centre-right positions
- **AI Persona**: In-depth analysis, editorial opinion integration, policy focus
- **Reaction Patterns**: Longer-form analysis, historical context, policy implications

### Social Media Platforms

#### Dutch Social Media Behavior

- **Twitter/X**: Professional political communication (some migration to Bluesky)
- **YouTube**: NOS and other outlets experimenting with Gen Z engagement

## AI Content Generation Architecture

### Multi-Tier AI System

#### Tier 1: Template-Based Responses (MVP Phase)
**Purpose**: Reliable, cost-effective content for predictable political events
**Implementation**:
- Pre-written article templates with variable insertion
- Reaction pattern libraries for different media outlets
- Simple sentiment analysis for positive/negative framing
- Fixed personality profiles for consistent media behavior

**Example Template System**:
```
Template: "Coalition Negotiation Progress"
Variables: [party_names], [policy_areas], [negotiation_stage], [time_pressure]
NOS_Style: "Coalition talks between {party_names} continue as negotiators work through differences on {policy_areas}..."
RTL_Style: "BREAKING: Coalition crisis as {party_names} clash over {policy_areas} with deadline approaching..."
```

#### Tier 2: AI-Enhanced Content (Phase 3)
**Purpose**: Dynamic responses to unexpected player actions
**Implementation**:
- LLM APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) for unique situation responses
- Media outlet persona prompting for consistent voice
- Real-time sentiment analysis and bias application
- Context-aware content generation based on political history

**AI Prompting System**:
```
System Prompt: "You are a journalist for NOS, the trusted Dutch public broadcaster. Write a news article about..."
Context: Current political situation, player actions, relevant background
Constraints: 150-250 words, formal tone, balanced perspective, Dutch political context
Output: Realistic news article in authentic NOS style
```

#### Tier 3: Advanced AI Systems (Future Enhancement)
**Purpose**: Sophisticated media ecosystem simulation
**Implementation**:
- Multi-model AI conversations (journalists interviewing AI politicians)
- Dynamic narrative generation across multiple media sources
- Cross-platform content coordination (social media + traditional media)
- Long-term memory for consistent media personalities and storylines

### Content Generation Workflows

#### News Article Generation
1. **Event Detection**: Player action triggers content generation need
2. **Outlet Selection**: Determine which media outlets would cover this event
3. **Bias Application**: Apply outlet-specific editorial perspective and framing
4. **Content Generation**: AI or template-based article creation
5. **Quality Control**: Content filtering and accuracy verification
6. **Publication**: Timed release to simulate realistic news cycles

#### Social Media Response Generation
1. **Platform Analysis**: Determine appropriate platforms for content type
2. **Demographic Targeting**: Generate age-appropriate responses for different platforms
3. **Viral Potential Assessment**: Determine if content should "trend" or remain niche
4. **Response Chain Generation**: Create realistic comment threads and discussions
5. **Influence Metrics**: Track reach, engagement, and political impact

## Media Framing Systems

### Framing Theory Implementation

#### Issue-Based Framing
Different outlets frame identical events through ideological lenses:

**Immigration Policy Example**:
- **Left-Leaning Outlet**: "New policy threatens vulnerable refugee families"
- **Right-Leaning Outlet**: "Government takes decisive action on border security"
- **Centrist Outlet**: "Coalition reaches compromise on immigration reform"

#### Political Party Framing
Consistent portrayal of parties based on media outlet biases:
- **PVV Coverage**: Range from "populist concerns" to "extremist rhetoric"
- **GL-PvdA Coverage**: Range from "progressive leadership" to "unrealistic idealism"
- **VVD Coverage**: Range from "pragmatic governance" to "elite interests"

#### Coalition Dynamics Framing
- **Stability Focus**: Emphasizes unity and effective governance
- **Conflict Focus**: Highlights disagreements and potential collapse
- **Process Focus**: Detailed coverage of negotiation mechanics
- **Personality Focus**: Individual politician conflicts and relationships

### Dynamic Bias Simulation

#### Outlet-Specific Bias Parameters
```yaml
NOS:
  bias_strength: 0.1  # Minimal bias, institutional neutrality
  topics:
    immigration: 0.0
    economy: 0.0
    europe: +0.1    # Slight pro-EU institutional bias

RTL:
  bias_strength: 0.3  # Moderate commercial bias
  topics:
    immigration: +0.2  # Slight conservative lean
    economy: +0.3      # Pro-business perspective
    conflict: +0.4     # Drama-focused coverage

Volkskrant:
  bias_strength: 0.4  # Strong editorial perspective
  topics:
    immigration: -0.3  # Liberal perspective
    environment: -0.4  # Strong environmental focus
    europe: -0.2       # Pro-EU integration
```

#### Bias Application Algorithms
- **Lexical Choice**: Different word selections for identical concepts
- **Source Selection**: Which experts and politicians get quoted
- **Context Emphasis**: Which background information is highlighted
- **Timing**: When stories are published relative to political events

        } else {
            self.fallback_content.generate_template_article(event)
