using UnityEngine.UIElements;

public class CoalitionFormationUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        var root = GetComponent<UIDocument>().rootVisualElement;

        // Create complex political interface
        var coalitionPanel = CreateCoalitionPanel();
        var partyDetailsPanel = CreatePartyDetailsPanel();
        var negotiationInterface = CreateNegotiationInterface();

        root.Add(coalitionPanel);
        root.Add(partyDetailsPanel);
        root.Add(negotiationInterface);
    }

    private VisualElement CreateCoalitionPanel()

    initialize_political_state()

func setup_coalition_interface():
    # Godot's UI system - excellent for complex interfaces
    var coalition_panel = preload("res://ui/CoalitionPanel.tscn").instantiate()
    var party_list = preload("res://ui/PartyList.tscn").instantiate()

    add_child(coalition_panel)

function createPoliticalSimulation() {
    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 1400,
        height: 900,
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: true,
            contextIsolation: false
        }
    });

    // Load React-based political interface
    mainWindow.loadFile('dist/index.html');
}

// React component for coalition formation
function CoalitionFormation({ parties, currentCoalition }) {
    return (
        <div className="political-interface">
            <PartySelector parties={parties} />
            <NegotiationPanel coalition={currentCoalition} />

- Performance optimization and platform testing
- Final UI polish and user experience refinement

### Fallback Strategy
Maintain **architecture independence** to enable potential migration to Godot 4.x:
- Abstract political simulation logic from engine-specific code
- Use data-driven design for political systems
- Standardize API interfaces for potential platform migration

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Unity 6 Specific Risks
**Risk**: Licensing costs for commercial success
**Mitigation**: Unity Personal is free up to $200K revenue; plan for licensing transition

**Risk**: Learning curve for C# and Unity systems
**Mitigation**: Invest in Unity training; leverage extensive documentation and community

### Godot 4.x Specific Risks
**Risk**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Unity
**Mitigation**: Prototype critical features early; maintain Unity as fallback option

**Risk**: Less mature tooling for complex desktop applications
**Mitigation**: Evaluate UI complexity requirements early in development

### Universal Risks
**Risk**: AI integration costs and complexity
**Mitigation**: Implement cost controls and caching; design fallback content systems

**Risk**: Complex political simulation performance
**Mitigation**: Profile continuously; use background processing for computational tasks

## Final Recommendation

**Choose Unity 6** as the primary development platform for COALITION, with the following strategic approach:

1. **Start with Unity 6** for optimal desktop simulation capabilities
2. **Maintain Godot 4.x as strategic fallback** for potential migration if circumstances change
3. **Design architecture independence** to enable platform flexibility
4. **Invest in Unity 6 training** to maximize development efficiency
5. **Prototype critical political simulation features early** to validate technology choices

Unity 6 provides the optimal combination of sophisticated UI capabilities, C# ecosystem maturity, and professional desktop application features needed for COALITION's complex political simulation requirements while maintaining excellent macOS compatibility and long-session performance characteristics.

The close scoring between options (Unity 6: 8.1, Godot: 7.8, Electron: 8.0) indicates that any choice can succeed with proper implementation, but Unity 6's game development ecosystem and desktop optimization give it the strategic advantage for COALITION's specific requirements.
