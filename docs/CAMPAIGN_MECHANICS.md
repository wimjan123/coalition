# COALITION - Pre-Election Campaign Phase Mechanics

## Overview

The Campaign Phase extends COALITION's Dutch political simulation to include the critical 6-month pre-election period that shapes the electoral landscape before coalition formation begins. This phase focuses on authentic Dutch campaign dynamics including social media strategy, TV debates, rallies, and sophisticated voter influence systems integrated with Unity 6's desktop environment.

Crisis Events: Variable influence (unexpected events shifting priorities)

Persuasion Resistance:
- Strong Partisans: Require multiple, credible contradictory messages
- Issue Voters: Focus intensely on 1-2 policy areas, resistant to other appeals
- Low Information: Respond to simple, repeated messages and visual cues
- High Information: Require detailed policy positions and logical consistency
- Tribal Loyalty: Group identity often outweighs individual policy preferences

Persuasion Timing:
- Early Campaign: Base building and issue positioning (high receptivity)
- Mid Campaign: Swing voter targeting and message refinement (moderate receptivity)
- Late Campaign: Mobilization and final persuasion (low receptivity, high stakes)
- Final Week: Pure mobilization, limited persuasion opportunity
```

#### Polling Impact Simulation

**Polling Methodology Simulation**
```
Polling Organization Profiles:

// Example: Social Media Manager Application
public class SocialMediaManagerApp : CampaignApplication

#### Campaign Data Integration

**Data Architecture**
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class CampaignState
{
    [Header("Campaign Progress")]
    public CampaignPhase currentPhase = CampaignPhase.EarlyPlanning;
    public DateTime campaignStartDate;
    public DateTime electionDate;
    public int daysUntilElection;

    [Header("Resources")]
    public CampaignFinances finances;
    public StaffAllocation staff;
    public TimeManagement schedule;

    [Header("Performance Metrics")]
    public PollingData currentPolling;
    public SocialMediaMetrics socialStats;
    public MediaCoverageAnalysis mediaMetrics;
    public VoterOutreachProgress outreach;

    [Header("Strategic Decisions")]
    public List<PolicyPosition> platformPositions;
    public List<CampaignEvent> scheduledEvents;
    public List<MediaAppearance> mediaBookings;
    public OppositionAnalysis competitorIntel;
}

public enum CampaignPhase
{
    EarlyPlanning,      // 6 months out: strategy and foundation building
    ActiveCampaigning,  // 3 months out: full campaign activities
    IntensivePeriod,    // 6 weeks out: debates, rallies, heavy media
    FinalSprint,        // 2 weeks out: mobilization and final persuasion
    ElectionWeek        // Final week: get-out-the-vote operations
}
```

**Real-Time Update System**
```csharp
public class CampaignUpdateManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Update Configuration")]
    public float socialMediaUpdateInterval = 15f;
    public float pollingUpdateInterval = 300f; // 5 minutes
    public float newsUpdateInterval = 60f;
    public float eventUpdateInterval = 10f;

    private Dictionary<UpdateType, float> lastUpdateTimes;
    private Queue<CampaignNotification> pendingNotifications;

    void Update()
    {
        CheckForSocialMediaUpdates();
        CheckForPollingChanges();
        CheckForBreakingNews();
        CheckForEventUpdates();
        ProcessNotificationQueue();
    }

    private void CheckForSocialMediaUpdates()
    {
        // Simulate real-time social media engagement
        // Likes, shares, comments, mentions tracking
        foreach (var platform in activePlatforms)
        {
            if (platform.HasNewEngagement())
            {
                UpdateSocialMetrics(platform);
                CreateEngagementNotification(platform);
            }
        }
    }

    private void CheckForPollingChanges()
    {
        // Simulate polling fluctuations based on campaign activities
        var newPolling = PollingSimulator.CalculateCurrentStanding();
        if (HasSignificantPollingChange(newPolling))
        {
            UpdatePollingDashboard(newPolling);
            CreatePollingNotification(newPolling);
        }
    }

    private void CreateCrisisAlert(CrisisType crisis, string description)
    {
        // Emergency notifications for campaign crises
        var alert = new CampaignNotification
        {
            Type = NotificationType.Crisis,
            Priority = NotificationPriority.Urgent,
            Title = $"URGENT: {crisis}",
            Message = description,
            RequiresImmediateAction = true,
            SuggestedResponses = CrisisManager.GetResponseOptions(crisis)
        };

        PushImmediateNotification(alert);
    }
}
```

#### Visual Design System

**Dutch Government Aesthetic**
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class DutchGovernmentTheme
{
    [Header("Color Palette")]
    public Color primaryOrange = new Color(1f, 0.4f, 0f);      // Dutch Orange
    public Color primaryBlue = new Color(0f, 0.2f, 0.5f);      // Government Blue
    public Color backgroundWhite = new Color(0.98f, 0.98f, 0.98f);
    public Color accentRed = new Color(0.8f, 0f, 0f);          // Alert/Warning
    public Color successGreen = new Color(0f, 0.6f, 0.2f);     // Positive Metrics

    [Header("Typography")]
    public Font primaryFont; // Professional sans-serif (Rijksoverheid style)
    public Font secondaryFont; // Supporting typeface
    public int baseFontSize = 14;
    public int headerFontSize = 18;
    public int titleFontSize = 24;

    [Header("Layout Standards")]
    public float standardPadding = 16f;
    public float windowBorderRadius = 8f;
    public float buttonHeight = 36f;
    public float inputFieldHeight = 32f;

    [Header("Government Branding")]
    public Sprite dutchCoatOfArms;
    public Sprite governmentSeal;
    public List<Sprite> ministerialLogos;
}

public class CampaignWindowStyling : MonoBehaviour
{
    public DutchGovernmentTheme theme;

    public void ApplyGovernmentStyling(GameObject window)
    {
        // Apply consistent Dutch government visual identity
        // Professional appearance suggesting authenticity and authority
    }

    public void CreateProfessionalButton(string text, UnityAction onClick)
    {
        // Standardized button styling matching Dutch government websites
    }

    public void DisplayOfficialNotification(string title, string message)
    {
        // Government-style notification design
    }
}
```

## Integration with Existing COALITION Systems

### Data Flow from Campaign to Coalition

**Campaign Legacy Effects**
```csharp
public class CampaignLegacyManager
{
    public CoalitionFormationData ExportCampaignResults(CampaignState finalState)
    {
        return new CoalitionFormationData
        {
            // Electoral results influenced by campaign performance
            ElectoralResults = CalculateFinalElectionResults(finalState),

            // Party relationships affected by campaign interactions
            InterPartyRelationships = AnalyzeCampaignInteractions(finalState),

            // Public opinion baseline for coalition negotiations
            PublicOpinionBaseline = finalState.currentPolling.ToPublicOpinion(),

            // Media narrative context for coalition coverage
            MediaNarrativeContext = finalState.mediaMetrics.EstablishPostElectionNarrative(),

            // Available political capital for coalition formation
            PoliticalCapital = CalculatePoliticalCapital(finalState)
        };
    }

    private ElectoralResults CalculateFinalElectionResults(CampaignState state)
    {
        // Campaign performance directly affects final vote share
        // Social media engagement → youth turnout
        // Rally attendance → base mobilization
        // Debate performance → swing voter persuasion
        // TV commercial effectiveness → broad message penetration
    }
}
```

### Authentic Dutch Campaign Integration

**Historical Campaign Simulation**
```csharp
public class HistoricalCampaignManager
{
    public void LoadHistoricalScenario(int electionYear)
    {
        switch (electionYear)
        {
            case 2017:
                SetupAntiEstablishmentWave();
                ConfigureRuttevsPVVDynamics();
                break;
            case 2021:
                SetupCovidElectionContext();
                ConfigureRutteLeadershipNarrative();
                break;
            case 2023:
                SetupPVVBreakthroughScenario();
                ConfigureFragmentationChallenges();
                break;
        }
    }

    private void SetupPVVBreakthroughScenario()
    {
        // 2023-specific campaign dynamics
        campaignContext.majorIssues = new[] {
            "Immigration", "Housing Crisis", "Farmer Protests", "EU Skepticism"
        };
        campaignContext.mediaFocus = MediaFocus.PopulistSurge;
        campaignContext.establishmentResponse = EstablishmentResponse.Defensive;
    }
}
```
