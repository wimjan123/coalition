5. **Feedback Integration**: Rapid iteration based on real user feedback

#### **Foundation Phase 2 Objectives (Weeks 9-12)**
1. **Technical Expansion**: High-priority features from user feedback
2. **Platform Extension**: Enhanced platform support and analytics
3. **Academic Integration**: Educational institution partnerships
4. **Investment Preparation**: Funding strategy for full development

- **Community platform** with 50+ active members
- **Educational materials** deployed in 2+ institutions

## Risk Assessment Phase 2
1. **User Recruitment**: Mitigated by multiple outreach channels
2. **Partnership Development**: Early academic engagement critical
3. **Technical Iteration**: Rapid development cycle needed
4. **Market Validation**: Community feedback integration essential

This transition strategy builds directly on the completed demo foundation while expanding into validation, community building, and strategic positioning for full development funding.
