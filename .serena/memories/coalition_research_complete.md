# COALITION Research Phase Complete

## Research Deliverables Created (2025-01-19)
- **COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md**: Political game market gaps, COALITION's blue ocean opportunities
- **NVIDIA_NIM_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Local LLM integration technical specs with Unity 6
- **CAMPAIGN_MECHANICS.md**: Pre-election phase design (social media, debates, rallies, ads)
- **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md**: 73 AI-implementable tasks across 6 demo milestones

## Key Findings
- **Market Gap**: No commercial games focus on Dutch coalition politics
- **Technical Opportunity**: NVIDIA NIM local LLM integration for real-time political AI
- **Missing Feature**: Pre-election campaign phase with modern social media mechanics
- **Unique Positioning**: Desktop environment metaphor + authentic Dutch political simulation

## Next Steps
- Unity 6 project structure setup with C# political simulation architecture
- Begin Phase 1 implementation following DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
- AI-assisted development with local NVIDIA NIM integration
