# COALITION System Architecture Analysis

## Current Implementation State (2025-01-19)

### Existing Components
- **GameManager.cs**: Main game controller with phase management and system initialization
- **EventBus.cs**: Static event system with type-safe pub/sub pattern
- **NIMClient.cs**: Complete NVIDIA NIM integration with caching and rate limiting
- **PoliticalParty.cs**: Comprehensive ScriptableObject for party data
- **PoliticalIssue.cs**: Data structure for political issues

### Critical Missing Implementations
- **PoliticalSystem**: Referenced in GameManager but not implemented
- **CampaignSystem**: Referenced in GameManager but not implemented  
- **AIResponseSystem**: Referenced in GameManager but not implemented
- **UIManager**: Referenced in GameManager but not implemented
- **ResponseCache**: Component referenced in NIMClient but not implemented

### Unity 6 Integration Status
- Project configured for Unity 6.0.0f1
- Core C# architecture in place
- ScriptableObject pattern properly implemented
- MonoBehaviour lifecycle correctly used

### Event System Architecture
- Static EventBus with Dictionary<Type, List<object>> storage
- Type-safe generic subscribe/publish pattern
- Exception handling for listener failures
- Clear() method for cleanup

### Performance Characteristics
- Event system uses reflection and boxing (potential performance issue)
- HTTP client with proper timeout and retry logic
- LRU cache pattern needed for response caching
- Rate limiting implemented with Queue<DateTime>

### Data Flow Patterns
- Event-driven communication between systems
- ScriptableObject-based data architecture
- Async/await pattern for AI integration
- Singleton pattern for GameManager

## Architecture Gaps Identified
1. Missing core system implementations prevent compilation
2. No scene configuration or prefab setup
3. No Unity package dependencies specified
4. EventBus may have performance issues at scale
5. No memory management for long sessions
6. No threading considerations for AI calls
